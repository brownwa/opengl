SUMMARY:

This folder includes tools for 3D matrix rotation in C. For
3D matrix rotation in C++ use the Boost C++ libraries:

	http://www.boost.org/

NOTES:
- This implementation suffers from gimble lock
- Matricies are defined as MxN, row by column
- All trig calculations require angles in radians
- All points are ROW vectors, which must be of exactly 1x4 dimension
- All matricies are of exactly 4x4 dimension
