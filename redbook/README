Environment:

Dell Inspiron 15 7559, Nvidia GeForce GTX 960M, Ubuntu 15.10

Required packages for Ubuntu 15.10:

Install order matters, specifically install the video card
package last. Note that you want to update your OS to the
latest version first. Also, if your OS is 32bit then append
":386i" to the end of all the package names. If a 32bit
version doesn't exist then apt-get will let you know. However
most people are running 64bit Linux if they're working with
OpenGL 4.x.

One note on the video card drivers, the apt repositories may
not give you the latest driver, which was the case for me
with the "nvidia-current" package. I had to find the name of
the most recent Nvidia package by opening the Ubuntu Software
& Updates utility, under the Additional Drivers tab.

sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic build-essential
sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
sudo apt-get install libxmu-dev libxmu-headers
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
sudo apt-get install libglew1.10
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev

# Bad!
#sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
# Good :)
sudo apt-get install nvidia-352-updates

Compile Line:

The -lGLEW library supercedes the -lGLU one, just make sure
to include the following two lines in your code:

#define GLEW_STATIC
#include <GL/glew.h>

From the command line:

g++ triangles.cpp LoadShaders.cpp -lGLEW -lGL -lglut -o triangles
