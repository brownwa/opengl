NOTES:
- Code requires OpenGL 3.2 or later. To check your version:

	$ glxinfo | grep OpenGL

- Also check that your graphics hardware is supported. To save
  you some frustration, VM graphics emulators tend to be a few
  versions behind regarding OpenGL. As of December 2015, VM Ware
  Fusion 7.x only supports up to OpenGL 2.1 for Ubuntu Linux.

	$ lspci | grep "VGA"

- Code uses GLX (OpenGL extension for X Window), Ubuntu environment:

	#include "GL/glx.h"

- Compile line is unchanged from other OpenGL projects. Just include
  the -g option to enable compiler's debug mode:

	gcc -g debugcontext.cpp debug.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut -o debugcontext
